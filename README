To build YAGI, do the following:

1. Download 'libantlr3c-3.4.tar.gz' from http://www.antlr3.org/download/C/
2. Unpack, ./configure, make, make install
3. In the YAGI root dir, run 'cmake .' and 'make'

The cmake script automatically downloads an builds the Google C++ unit test framework gtest.
The make command builds executeables "yagi" (the integerpreter application) and "yagi-unitTests" (runs all the unit tests).

Currently the unit tests only work on systems that supports -pthread.
